# Artifact Layout

- `checkpoints/`: model checkpoints runnable on cluster
- `indices/`: retrieval indexes and embedding stores
- `logs/`: run logs and stage traces
- `reports/`: evaluation tables, plots, and error analysis outputs

These folders are scaffolded for reproducibility and should be populated by pipeline runs.
