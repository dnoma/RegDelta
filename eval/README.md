# Evaluation Harness Plan

Planned contents:
- dataset manifests and train/dev/test splits
- metric runners for translation fidelity, extraction quality, and hallucination bounding
- ablation runners (prompt-only vs RAG, RAG vs LoRA, single vs verifier model)
- report exporters for reproducible tables and charts
